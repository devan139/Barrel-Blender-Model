Proud to share a recent project where I modeled a realistic wooden barrel in Blender 3D. This piece involved end-to-end design and animation, including:
ðŸŽ¯ High-quality 3D modeling with attention to material detail
 ðŸ’¡ Lighting analysis using HDRIs to enhance reflections and realism
 ðŸŽ¬ Created a full animation showreel, edited with Blender's video editor and finalized in Premiere Pro
 ðŸ§± Used open-source textures and embedded all assets for portability

This project reflects my passion for realistic 3D modeling and visual storytelling. Always excited to push creative boundaries using industry-standard tools!
